I made this back in like 7th grade for our final project. In hindsight, there's so many bad lines of code in here that I shudder every time I think about it. But, looking back, it was pretty fun regardless of how bad the code was. Take a look!
At the very least, you'll get a quick laugh. But play enough and who knows? Maybe you might just get addicted.
